# Consolidation-Project

## Project Overview
I really enjoyed working with HTML even though it was a huge challenge for me. I definitely put a lot of work into not only the code and structure, but also into the actual content of it. I definitely see room for expanding on the website, so when I found out Twine is HTML based I thought it would be cool to add Twine as a page to my website. My favorite artist of all time is Johnny Cash (especially because of the stories of his life and behind his songs), but could not find a way to fit him into my previous project. I decided for Consolidation I would create a Twine that allowed a user to decide his/her story line in writing songs using Johnny Cash's own life story. For example, one page might say you want to write a song in a short time. You have the options "one night" (You then get "Cry! Cry! Cry!, which Cash wrote in one night) or "twenty minutes" (You then get "I Walk the Line", Cash's biggest hit that he wrote in twenty minutes). 

## Brief overview of your project goals:
My main goal for this project is to further improve my HTML project and also
learn how to use a new platform (Twine). I really enjoyed working with HTML
and the challenge it provided me, yet I definitely see room for improvement in
the overall site. I also want to learn how to have the site visitable by other
people without them having to download the entire repository--I tried to do
this for the project and could not figure it out in time for the due date!


## Task list for your project
- Outline story for Twine, including options/connections
- Create Twine document
- Add any necessary graphics to Twine
- Connect Twine to original HTML site
- Make any adjustments necessary to have Twine run in the site
