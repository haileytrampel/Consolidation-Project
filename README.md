# Consolidation-Project

## Brief overview of your project goals:
My main goal for this project is to further improve my HTML project and also
learn how to use a new platform (Twine). I really enjoyed working with HTML
and the challenge it provided me, yet I definitely see room for improvement in
the overall site. I also want to learn how to have the site visitable by other
people without them having to download the entire repository--I tried to do
this for the project and could not figure it out in time for the due date!


## Task list for your project
- Outline story for Twine, including options/connections
- Create Twine document
- Add any necessary graphics to Twine
- Connect Twine to original HTML site
- Make any adjustments necessary to have Twine run in the site
